<div class="problem">
  <h2 class="title">The Problem</h2>
  <p>There are over 11 million people in the UK with a disability,
     however accessibility within web is not widely implemented.
     The aim of this project was to develop a HTML, CSS and JS framework
     that fully integrates current accessibility standards. This Framework
     would be run on a web page, where it would then produce error boxes
     with error messages for each of the accessibility issues on the page.</p>
</div>

<div class="research">
  <h2 class="title">Research</h2>
  <p>To research and investigate web accessibility, a literature review was
     conducted to find out what standards and tools are out there for helping
     developers make their sites accessible. This literature review also looked
     into why accessibility on sites is not widely considered and what could be
     the causes of this.This literature review found that while there are a
     number of tools and guidelines out there to help developers make their
     websites accessible, they are not being used. To find out whether websites
     are adhering to current accessibility standards and complete objective two,
     desk research was done on 10 beauty websites. The desk research found that
     accessibility standards were not being adhered to.</p>

<div class="design">
  <h2 class="title">Design</h2>
  <p>Low-fidelity prototypes were used to create quick, rough
    sketches of different designs. High-fidelity prototypes
    were used to create the final look of the website. The button
    containing the framework and the error boxes produced were designed
    to be red because this framework is checking for errors and errors
    are usually represented by the colour red.</p>

<div class="build">
  <h2 class="title">Build</h2>
  <p>The framework was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.
  The button containing the framework can either be dragged into the bookmarks
  (if using Google Chrome) or saved as a bookmark. When the bookmark is run
  on a web page, the framework checks for accessibility issues and produces
  error boxes with error messages for each of the issues.</p>
</div>

<div class="test">
  <h2 class="title">Test</h2>
  <p>This build was tested using manual testing, which involved
     creating a test plan containing a number of test cases. When
     this test was conducted, the result was written up, along
     with whether or not the build passed this test.</p>
