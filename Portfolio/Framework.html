      <!--This is the problem text-->
      <p>There are over 11 million people in the UK with a disability,
         however accessibility within web is not widely implemented.
         The aim of this project was to develop a HTML, CSS and JS framework
         that fully integrates current accessibility standards. This Framework
         would be run on a web page, where it would then produce error boxes
         with error messages for each of the accessibility issues on the page.</p>

      <!--This is the research text-->
      <p>To research and investigate web accessibility, a literature review was
         conducted to find out what standards and tools are out there for helping
         developers make their sites accessible. This literature review also looked
         into why accessibility on sites is not widely considered and what could be
         the causes of this.This literature review found that while there are a
         number of tools and guidelines out there to help developers make their
         websites accessible, they are not being used. To find out whether websites
         are adhering to current accessibility standards and complete objective two,
         desk research was done on 10 beauty websites. The desk research found that
         accessibility standards were not being adhered to.</p>

      <p>Low-fidelity prototypes were used to create quick, rough
        sketches of different designs. High-fidelity prototypes
        were used to create the final look of the website. The button
        containing the framework and the error boxes produced were designed
        to be red because this framework is checking for errors and errors
        are usually represented by the colour red.</p>

      <p>The framework was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.
      The button containing the framework can either be dragged into the bookmarks
      (if using Google Chrome) or saved as a bookmark. When the bookmark is run
      on a web page, the framework checks for accessibility issues and produces
      error boxes with error messages for each of the issues.</p>

         creating a test plan containing a number of test cases. When

         with whether or not the build passed this test.</p>
