      <p>The problem was that Smaller Earth were looking for ideas
      to promote their Summer Camp in Canada program. They decided
      they would like a virtual game that could sit on any web page
      of the Smaller Earth site. This game would be a spinner game
      in which the user could click a button to "Spin the Moose".
      When the button is clicked, the moose would spin through 8
      different prizes on the wheel and land on a random prize.
      Before the user can claim their prize, a form is produced that
      requires the users to enter their name, email and phone number.</p>

      <p>Low-fidelity prototypes were used to create quick, rough
        sketches of different designs. High-fidelity prototypes
        were used to create the final look for the game.
        A carnival theme was chosen because this build is to be a game
        and carnivals are known for having lots of games. The background
        for the game became a carnival stall, with a prizes board,
        the spin the moose board and a carnival man. The colours for
        the spin the moose board were taken from the Smaller Earth
        website to help it fit in with the rest of the site.</p>

      <p>The game was created using HTML, SASS and JavaScript. When the
      button is clicked, a form appears asking the user for their name,
      phone number and email address. When they submit this information,
      the moose spins and the carnival man announces the players prize
      in a speech bubble.</p>

      <p>This build was tested using manual testing, which involved
         creating a test plan containing a number of test cases. When
         this test was conducted, the result was written up, along
         with whether or not the build passed this test. User
         testing was also conducted on this build. This involved users
         using the build and completing tasks to see how easy it was
         for users to use this game.
