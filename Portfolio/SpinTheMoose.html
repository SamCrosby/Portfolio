<div class="process">
<div class="problem">
  <h2 class="title">The Problem</h2>
  <p>The problem was that Smaller Earth were looking for ideas
  to promote their Summer Camp in Canada program. They decided
  they would like a virtual game that could sit on any web page
  of the Smaller Earth site. This game would be a spinner game
  in which the user could click a button to "Spin the Moose".
  When the button is clicked, the moose would spin through 8
  different prizes on the wheel and land on a random prize.
  Before the user can claim their prize, a form is produced that
  requires the users to enter their name, email and phone number.</p>

<div class="design">
  <h2 class="title">Design</h2>
  <p>Low-fidelity prototypes were used to create quick, rough
    sketches of different designs. High-fidelity prototypes
    were used to create the final look for the game.
    A carnival theme was chosen because this build is to be a game
    and carnivals are known for having lots of games. The background
    for the game became a carnival stall, with a prizes board,
    the spin the moose board and a carnival man. The colours for
    the spin the moose board were taken from the Smaller Earth
    website to help it fit in with the rest of the site.</p>

<div class="build">
  <h2 class="title">Build</h2>
  <p>The game was created using HTML, SASS and JavaScript. When the
  button is clicked, a form appears asking the user for their name,
  phone number and email address. When they submit this information,
  the moose spins and the carnival man announces the players prize
  in a speech bubble.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="test">
  <h2 class="title">Test</h2>
  <p>This build was tested using manual testing, which involved
     creating a test plan containing a number of test cases. When
     this test was conducted, the result was written up, along
     with whether or not the build passed this test. User
     testing was also conducted on this build. This involved users
     using the build and completing tasks to see how easy it was
     for users to use this game.
